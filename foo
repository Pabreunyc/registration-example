When building Angular components, we often use data structures like arrays and hashtable to build a
collection of objects.  This enables us to use HTML templates to iterate the collection and display
the object properties using the ngFor directive. It is here that we come across a behavior that
seems to confuse some developers. In some cases, ngFor raises the only support iterables error when
iterating over these collections. The question is why do we get this error?
